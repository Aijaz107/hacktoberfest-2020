The Open Source community is the best place to learn and contribute! Have a question? Browse a forum...chances are, someone has been stuck on this problem too. Have a solution? Pay it forward and help someone else :) There is always an opportunity to grow and learn. You never know what you may find -- someone might have come up with a new and interesting solution. You may also pick up a new language ;)

Documentaries of places you've never been to are wonderful. Being there to experience it yourself is a blessing. Let's all do our best to take care of this planet for future generations to come.

Please enjoy this photos I took from my trip back home to South East Asia. Feel free to contact me on GitHub if you can guess where this is :) Selamat Hacktoberfest!

## For the Future!
